# A Wargame - Description
**This application was made for an uni assignment and its aim is solely recreational, therefore it is not meant to be a real simulation of any sort!!!<br/>**

By nature, it is a call back to classical war-like real-time strategy games, making use of the basic features that the games pertaining to the genre usually implement.<br/>

(e.g. building an army by recruiting troops, attacking another playerâ€™s army etc.).<br/>

The game has a little login feature that uses local data stored as JSON files and supports 2 types of users: **admin** and **player**.<br/>

The **admin** can visualize the list of players, ban a misbehaving player, watch how any of the players are doing by following their game state.<br/>

Each **player** is naturally presented with their game state as soon as they log in (currency, army status, report of recent battles).<br/>
They can recruit new troops to improve the force of their army or attack other players and pillage their gold.
